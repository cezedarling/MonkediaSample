# Monkedia Sample

Super simple PHP, MySQL sample with JQuery DataGrid to display and select clients.

I used straight forward procedural PHP to code this. It was a fairly simple task so I didn't bother adding into MVC or a framework.


The base URL will need to be updated in the config.php file if you take the files out of the folder or don't run on localhost/

Also,
The db.php file would need to be updated to reflect proper host, username, password and Database name.

Thanks.
